				In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual
				obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.
				<p>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</p>

				<p>
					We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time. In some
					exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
					<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
					<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>

					<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
					<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
					<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>

				<p>In Short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>
				<p>
					We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with
					basic site functions.

					your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.

				<p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
				<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>
				<p>
					When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
					personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
				</p>
				<h2 id="7">What are your privacy rights?</h2>
				<p>
					In Short: Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or
					terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.
				</p>
				<p>
					In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the
					processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by
					contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section <a href="#11">"How can you contact us about this notice?"</a> below.
				</p>
				<p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
				<p>
					If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">Member State data protection authority</a> or

				<p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at info@inkattitude.it.</p>
				<h2 id="8">Controls for do-not-track features</h2>
				<p>
					Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform
					technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we
					must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
				</p>
				<p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
				<h2 id="9">Do United States residents have specific rights?</h2>

					In Short: If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the personal information
